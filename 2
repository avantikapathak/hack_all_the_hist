I am in Frankfurt.
8am.
I drank espresso in a cafe near some plaza.
The trains are expansive.
The people wear a lot of black here. eighty percent or more.
I think I am going to go see Goethe's house, because why not?
I've never dealt with the devil himself, but the other way is less horrifying.
I don't really know why I paid the ten bux to get on that train, but I am even thinking about staying a night here.
Maybe more.
I bet there is a hackerspace here, and I like the mojo of this town.
It's situated at the intersection of two major rivers in Germany. The Main, and the Rhine. I didn't really know about the Main, but for some reason crossing the Rhine was a really big deal about seventy years ago. Something to do with war, or something. I am having trouble getting a reasonable internet connection, also. So I might be stuck with a quick jaunt, but that's really what is more useful at this point anyway. I wish I could charge my computer on the plane, maybe I will on the next one. Regardless, I think it's almost time for me to go track downthis house I am looking for.
